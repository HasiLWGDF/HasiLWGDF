# HasiLWGDF
A lightweight, open-source, 2D and 3D game engine/framework written in C++. HasiLWGDF provides support for lightweight and easy game development, using multiple graphics backends (both for 2D and 3D) and much more. HasiLWGDF is mostly inspired by Godot and Unity.
This repository contains the core of the HasiLWGDF project, providing an easy-to-use framework for developing simple games and prototypes, with support for input handling, graphics rendering, physics management and audio handling behind the scenes.

As said earlier, HasiLWGDF supports multiple graphics backend. Such as OpenGL (3.2+), Vulkan (1-1.3), Direct3D/DirectX (9, 11, 12), Metal, OpenGL ES (Currently only 2.0 is supported) and Software.

The core of the engine is designed to be lightweight and fast, with minimal overhead and efficient resource management. It supports a variety of platforms, and can be easily integrated with other libraries and frameworks.

## Platforms
| OS | Renderers | Versions/Variants | Architectures | Compilers | Support |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Android | OpenGL ES, Software, Vulkan | 6+ | arm, arm64, amd64, i386 | Clang, GCC | WIP üîß |
| Android TV | OpenGL ES, Software, Vulkan | 9+ | arm, arm64, i386, amd64 | Clang, GCC | Delayed ‚è± |
| iOS | Metal, OpenGL ES, Software, Vulkan | 12+ | arm, arm64, amd64 | Apple Clang | Delayed ‚è± |
| Linux | OpenGL, Software, Vulkan | Any | amd64, arm64, i386 | Clang, GCC | WIP üîß |
| macOS | Metal, OpenGL, Software, Vulkan | 11+ | amd64, arm64 | Apple Clang, GCC | Delayed ‚è± |
| UWP | Direct3D/DirectX, Software | Any | Any | MSVC | Delayed ‚è± |
| Windows | Direct3D/DirectX, OpenGL, Software, Vulkan | 7+ | amd64, i386 | MinGW, MSYS, MSVC | WIP üîß |
| HTML5/Javascript | WebGL, WebGPU | Any | Any | None | Delayed ‚è± |
| Node.JS | WebGL, WebGPU | v14+ | Any | None | Delayed ‚è± |

Currently, there is no official support for using build tools other than CMake for using HasiLWGDF. Though you can try it yourself to see if it works (Note: IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED SINCE MOST OF THE DEPENDENCIES REQUIRE CMAKE AND MAY NOT WORK AS INTENDED).

HasiLWGDF Project is split into 3 parts.
1. Core Library (This repo)
2. Editor Application ([HasiLWGDF Editor](https://github.com/HasiLWGDF-Editor))
3. Multi-Player Framework ([HasiLWGDF GS](https://github.com/HasiLWGDF-GS))

In future, we might make language bindings for Java, JavaScript (Rewrite supporting only WebGL and WebGPU, because Emscripten might not work well since we have multiple graphics APIs and stuff), Node.JS (Rewrite like JavaScript, but as a Node.JS package), C#, Haxe, Lua, Rust, Ruby, Go, Python etc.

All kind of contributions and feedback are welcome!
